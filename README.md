# Linear-Nonlinear-Kinetics-Spiking(LNKS) model
The LNKS model is used in the lab to understand computations of contrast adaptation in the retina. The LNKS model forms a cascaded connection of four model blocks - linear filter, nonlinearity(threshold, saturation), a first-order dynamic system(markov chain like transition), and a nonlinearity with a feedback.

This repository keeps the tools and examples for using Linear-Nonlinear-Kinetics-Spiking(LNKS) model, also including tools for  Linear-Nonlinear-Kinetics(LNK) model as well.
